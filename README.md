# sql-challenge
In this project I was tasked with a research project on employees of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remained of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

From this I created the tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answered questions about the data.

### Data Modeling
- Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables.

### Data Engineering
- I then used the information I have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.
- I then imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. 

### Data Analysis
- List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
- List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
- List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
- List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
- List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
